# New Year's Countdown

This project is a simple static webpage that displays a countdown to the next New Year's Day. (I made it in an hour because I was too lazy to lookup a countdown online) 



## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `js/countdown.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the countdown.
- `css/styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the webpage.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The countdown will start automatically and update every second.

## Customization

You can customize the look and feel of the countdown by modifying the `css/styles.css` file. If you want to change the behavior of the countdown, you can modify the `js/countdown.js` file.

Please note that this project uses plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and does not require any external libraries or frameworks.
